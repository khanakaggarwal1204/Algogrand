# ðŸŒ± MemoryGame dApp (Built on Algorand)

Welcome to **MemoryGame**, a simple yet powerful decentralized application (dApp) built on the **Algorand blockchain** using TypeScript smart contracts.  
This project is designed to be an easy-to-understand example for anyone getting started with Algorand development.  

---

## ðŸ“– Project Description  
**MemoryGame** is a lightweight dApp that demonstrates how to build, deploy, and interact with smart contracts on Algorand.  
It uses a global state to store a hidden value and allows users to make a guess. If the guess matches the stored value, the contract returns `"match"`; otherwise, it returns `"wrong"`.  

This project serves as a **starter template** for developers who want to learn the basics of Algorand smart contracts, state management, and user interaction.  

---

## âš¡ What It Does  
- Stores a hidden number in the contractâ€™s global state.  
- Accepts a userâ€™s guess as input.  
- Returns `"match"` if the guess equals the hidden number, otherwise returns `"wrong"`.  

---

## ðŸŒŸ Features  
- âœ… **Beginner-friendly**: Minimal and easy-to-read code for new Algorand developers.  
- âœ… **Global State**: Demonstrates how to store and manage global variables in a smart contract.  
- âœ… **Fast & Secure**: Built on the Algorand blockchain with low fees and high throughput.  
- âœ… **Customizable**: Can be extended into games, quizzes, or more complex logic.
